# Angular Course Project

This web application is the one built while doing the “Angular – The Complete Guide (2023 Edition)” Course on Udemy.

## Objective

The goal in this project is to make a `Recipe Book` and `Shopping List` App, where those are the main sections. After signing up to use the app, users will be able to manage their recipes, view them in detail, push ingredients from a recipe directly to the shopping list, and also manage their shopping list.

So far, thanks to this course I have learned about:

- Components
- Databinding
- Directives
- Lifecycle Hooks
- Services
- Dependency Injection
- Routing
- Observables
- Handling Forms (Template-Driven and Reactive Approach)
- Pipes
- Making Http Requests
- Authentication and Route Protection
- Dynamic Components
- Modules and Optimizing Angular Apps
- Deploying an Angular App

### General Information

- This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.
