# Angular Course Project

This web application is the one built while doing “Angular – The Complete Guide (2022 Edition)” Course on Udemy.

## Objective

The goal in this project which we will build throughout the course, is to build a `Recipe Book` and `Shopping List App`. Basically, we're going to have two sections: shopping list and recipe book. We will be able to manage our recipes, view them in detail, and also to manage our shopping list and even push ingredients from a recipe directly to the shopping list.

## General Information

* This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.
* Bootstrap version: 3.4.1
* Status: In Development
