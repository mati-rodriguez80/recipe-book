# Angular Course Project

This web application is the one built while doing “Angular – The Complete Guide (2023 Edition)” Course on Udemy.

## Objective

The goal in this project which it will be built throughout the course, is to make a `Recipe Book` and `Shopping List` App. Basically, it is going to have two sections: shopping list and recipe book. We will be able to manage our recipes, view them in detail, and also to manage our shopping list, and even push ingredients from a recipe directly to the shopping list.

So far, thanks to this course I have learned about:

- Components
- Databinding
- Directives
- Lifecycle Hooks
- Services
- Dependency Injection
- Routing
- Observables
- Handling Forms (Template-Driven and Reactive Approach)
- Pipes
- Making Http Requests
- Authentication and Route Protection
- Dynamic Components
- Modules and Optimizing Angular Apps
- Deploying an Angular App

## General Information

- This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.
